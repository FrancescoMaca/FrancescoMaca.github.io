    This was my first actual project made in C# and Winform back in 2017. The app
    would encode and decode files based on a given password. There is a 'folder'
    option that allows you to encode entire folders.

    This was a project done to learn how CPU scheduler algorithms work. There are a
    few implemented algorithms to schedule tasks, as well as taking context-switch and
    user-kernel mode switch times in consideration.
    There are five supported algorithms:
    - FCFS / First-Come-First-Served            \$\{ /* [[URL:FCFS,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)]] */ \}
    - SJF / Shortest-Job-First                  \$\{ /* [[URL:SJF,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_job_next]] */ \}
    - SRTF / Shortest-Remaining-Time-First      \$\{ /* [[URL:SRTF,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_remaining_time]] */ \}
    - Round Robin                               \$\{ /* [[URL:RR,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling]] */ \}
    - Priority                                  \$\{ /* [[URL:Priority,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)]] */ \}

    I am pretty proud of this as my second project.

    This application is built on Googleâ€™s Blockly library, enabling users to create their
    own Discord bots without writing any code. With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface,
    users can easily design bots by selecting from a wide range of actions, such as sending
    messages, kicking or banning users, and much more. It's a simple, code-free way to bring
    your custom Discord bot to life!

    I have been collaborating with an Italian freelancer on a mobile application designed for
    book lovers to connect with others who share their passion for reading. The app places a
    strong emphasis on books and literary interests, rather than appearance. We are also partnering
    with Mondadori, one of Italy's largest and most respected book publishers.

    This is my 3rd version of the portfolio. I change ideas a lot, but while I work on
    websites and projects I keep changing ideas, and I also become better and better,
    making me re-think of the whole project. But I think this is going to be the last
    version for a big while!
